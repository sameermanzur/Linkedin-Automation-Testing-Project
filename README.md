# LinkedIn Automation Testing Project
## üìå Overview

This project automates LinkedIn recruiter outreach using Playwright with TypeScript.
It reads recruiter names from an Excel file, searches for them on LinkedIn, navigates to their profiles, opens the message dialog, and sends a personalized message.

The framework also integrates with Zephyr for Jira for test case management, and is designed to run locally as well as in CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Docker).

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

Playwright (E2E browser automation)

TypeScript (strong typing and maintainability)

ExcelJS / XLSX (data-driven tests using recruiter names)

Node.js & npm (dependency management)

Dotenv (environment variables for credentials & config)

Zephyr Reporter (test management integration with Jira)

Allure Reports (visual test execution reports)

Docker & Jenkins (CI/CD pipeline support)

## üß© Page Object Model (POM)

This project uses the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern for clean, reusable, and maintainable test automation. Each page has its own class with dedicated methods.

basePage.ts ‚Üí Core utilities (navigation, waits, common actions)

loginPage.ts ‚Üí Handles login (username, password, submit)

linkedInSearchPage.ts ‚Üí Manages recruiter search

composeMessage.ts ‚Üí Automates recruiter message composition

logoutPage.ts ‚Üí Handles logout flow

readRecruiterNames.ts ‚Üí Reads recruiter data from Excel (data-driven tests)
